"What type of motion occurs when one voice stays still while the other moves?","Oblique motion","lesson::003 type::vocabulary topic::motion"
"What is <b>enharmonic modulation</b>?","Changing keys by using a note that exists in both keys (spelled differently); also called common tone modulation","lesson::003 type::vocabulary topic::expression"
"What modulation technique uses a note that exists in both keys as a pivot point?","Enharmonic modulation (or common tone modulation)","lesson::003 type::vocabulary topic::expression"

"What is the whole/half step pattern for <b>melodic minor</b> (ascending)?","W-H-W-W-W-W-H","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"How does <b>natural minor</b> sound?","Pure, folk-like","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"How does <b>harmonic minor</b> sound?","Exotic, classical (due to the augmented 2nd)","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"How does <b>melodic minor</b> sound?","Smooth, less exotic than harmonic minor","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"Why doesn't natural minor have a strong pull back to the tonic?","The 7th scale degree is a whole step below the root (no leading tone)","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"How does harmonic minor create a leading tone?","By raising the 7th degree to be a half step below the root","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"What ""problem"" does raising the 7th in harmonic minor create?","An augmented 2nd (1.5 steps) between the 6th and 7th degrees — the ""exotic"" sound","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"How does melodic minor solve the augmented 2nd problem?","By raising both the 6th and 7th when ascending (reverts to natural minor going down)","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
"Between which scale degrees does the augmented 2nd appear in harmonic minor?","Between degrees 6 and 7","lesson::003 type::concept topic::scales"
